Explanation:
Student Class:

This class contains three private attributes: name, age, and grade.
It has a constructor to initialize a new student object and a method display() to print the student details.
The saveToFile() method writes student details to a file.
The static method loadFromFile() reads student details from a file and returns a Student object.
Menu System:

The program displays a simple text-based menu that lets the user choose between adding students, displaying the list of students, saving them to a file, and loading them from a file.
It uses a vector<Student> to store student objects dynamically.
File Handling:

The program uses file streams (ofstream for writing and ifstream for reading) to store and retrieve student data from a file named "students.txt".
Key Concepts Covered:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Learn to create classes and objects, encapsulating data and behavior.
File I/O: Understand how to save and load data from a file using C++ streams.
Vectors: Practice using dynamic arrays (std::vector) for flexible data storage.
Basic Control Structures: Reinforce knowledge of control structures (loops, switch-case statements).
This project provides a solid introduction to C++ and can be expanded with features like error handling, better input validation, and more advanced file handling techniques.
